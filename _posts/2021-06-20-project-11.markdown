description: Once again using AMD Radeon™ ProRender® 3.1 for Blender, we delivered over 60 hyperreal images for AMD and the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team. We were responsible for conceptualization, material and shading development, lighting, environment, and final look development. <br.<br><img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/w12-b.jpg"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/w12-c.jpg"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/w12-d.jpg"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/w12-e.jpg"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/w12-f.jpg"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/w12-g.jpg"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/w12-h.jpg"><br>ProRender has matured a lot since the last year and that is evident in the huge amount of variety of lighting scenarios we were able to explore in a short period of time.<br>AMD, the AMD Arrow logo, Radeon, and combinations thereof are trademarks of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.<br>
